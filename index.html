     <p id="tribute-info">On June 1st, Earhart started out on her biggest adventure. Accompanied by her navigator, Fred Noonan, the two departed from Miami and began a 29,000-mile journey around the world.  Unfortunately, on July 2nd, 1937, Earhart and Noonan took off from Lea Airfield with just 7,000 miles left of their journey.  Their intended destination was Howland Island for their next fueling.  As dawn neared, Earhart called the ITASCA, reporting cloudy weather. In later transmissions, Earhart asked the ITASCA to take bearings on her. The ITASCA sent her a steady stream of transmissions, but Earhart was unable to hear them. Her radio transmissions, irregular through most of the flight, were faint or interrupted with static. Around 7:40 am, the Itasca picked up the message stating: “Fuel is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.” The ship tried to reply, but were unable to make contact. At 8:45 am, Earhart reported: “We are running north and south”. Nothing further was heard from her.</p>
